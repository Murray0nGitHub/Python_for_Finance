#We need to calculate and output the Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio of a company.
#The P/E is the share price of the company's stock divided by the EPS (Earnings Per Share).

#The company's share price and average EPS for the past 12 months are stored in corresponding variables.
#Use these values to calculate the P/E ratio for the company, store it in a variable called pe, and output its value.
#First define a variable called pe, assign it the formula for the p/e ratio, then use it in a print statement.


price = 160.8
eps = 3.42

pe = price/eps
print(pe)
